# 🃏 Tarot Progress Check

**Tarot Progress Check** is a simple, interactive web app that draws a 3-card tarot spread to help users reflect on their current energy, unseen influences, and likely outcomes. Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, the app offers a sleek flip-card animation, mobile responsiveness, and randomized upright/reversed readings with card meanings.
